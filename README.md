Learning to code in C++ - first encounter.

Dear Codecool team, the story of my coding is very simple.
Due to job burnout I have decided to end my recent employment in a factory and begin a brand new career.
At first the aim was only to gain new qualifications, but I grew to like it.
There is a sense of strange satisfaction in finding a bug and fixing it.
